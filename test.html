          <p><span class="font-weight-bold text-dark">By operating a Chambers-model, we recruit Partners with expertise in their practice areas, and allow them to focus on delivering value to their clients.</span> By steering clear of the traditional hierarchical structure of law firms and by using the latest technologies, we reduce overhead costs. By not having junior lawyers our time is spent on looking out for our clients not training.</p> 
          
          <p class="m-0"><span class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Our partners will always be on hand to deliver personal attention.</span> By getting to know you and your business, and by not delegating to junior lawyers, we aim to increase the value offered to you.</p> 
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/620x437" alt="" class="img-fluid my-4">
          <p>Without a hierarchical structure found in most law firms our Partners are free to give you the time and focus you need, without the need to feed the top of a pyramid or follow bureaucratic rules.</p>
          
          <p><span class="font-weight-bold text-dark text-dark">We believe in flexible fee arrangements including capped and fixed structures to provide clients with certainty and clarity for their engagements.</span> This allows our Partners to focus on what is truly important – effective and relevant advice delivered efficiently. Our unique Chambers-model allows us to be more competitive than other law firms.</p>
          
          <p><span class="font-weight-bold text-dark text-dark">We provide tailored advice to our clients.</span> By applying the skills we have we can advise a wide variety of clients, from startups to multinationals, using the firm’s unique model.</p>
